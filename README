README for PulseAudioOSX

[DISCLAIMER - please note that this documentation is about how things
 are supposed to work. By far not all of this is yet implemented.
 Stay tuned.]


PulseAudioOSX is a suite of Mac OS X specific software packages that aim
to make PulseAudio fully supported on this platform.


1. PulseAudioKext - the kernel extension

The kernel extension registers any number of virtual sound devices that
can be used to playback on or record from. Each audio device has a
configurable number of input and output channels. Any CoreAudio
application can use these devices.

The buffer used to keep the audio data is exported to userspace as
shared memory and is forwarded to PulseAudio from there. The only
userspace that attaches to this driver is the PADaemon. See below for
more details.

Audio data can either be clocked by the kernel driver itself or by
PulseAudio.


2. PADaemon - the kernel driver counterpart

The driver needs to have a userspace part which is implemented in
PADaemon. This is also the only userspace client allowed. All other
clients communicate with the daemon, not with the driver directly.

The daemon is a StartupItem which is loaded automatically on system
start. Upon startup, the daemon reads a plist file to restore the
previously configured audio devices.

For each newly created audio device, the shared memory buffer exported
by the driver is mapped and the connection to either a local or a remote 
PulseAudio daemon is opened.


3. PAPreferencePane

A PreferencePane for SystemPreferences.app which lets the user add and
remove virtual audio devices, configure their number of input and output
channels and the PulseAudio instance to connect to.

Another function is to configure the local PA daemon, if any.
